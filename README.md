# Virtual Threads: Ushering in a New Era of Concurrency

###

Project Loom introduces virtual threads, lightweight threads that aim to dramatically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and monitoring high-throughput concurrent applications on the Java platform. â€¨We will begin with an overview of virtual threads and their evolution through JEPs 425, 436, and 444, discussing their design goals and integration into the JDK. We will then dive into practical examples, demonstrating how to create and manage virtual threads using the new Executors API, and showcasing their compatibility with existing Java code. Then this talk will explore a bit on how virtual threads are implemented,. how they solve our modern problems, and what, if any, shortcomings there may be.


This include source code that I used in the demo.


It requires JDK 21.
